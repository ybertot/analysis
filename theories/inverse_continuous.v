(* All uses of this lemma have been removed, replacing them with
  uses of interval_is_interval, but it would be better if
  is_interval used large comparisons instead of strict ones. *)
Lemma itvcc_le (x y : R) (I : interval R) :
  x <= y -> (`[x, y] <= I)%O = ((x \in I) && (y \in I)).
Proof.
by move=> C; case: I => [[[] l| []] [[|] u| [|]]];
  rewrite !subitvE ?in_itv -?andbA //=; apply/idP/idP;
  repeat (move/andP=>[] ?); move=> ?; repeat (apply/andP; split=> //);
  rewrite ?(le_trans C) ?(le_trans _ C) ?(lt_le_trans _ C) ?(le_lt_trans C).
Qed.

(* This is just an example showing how to use interval_is_interval
  in the case of large comparisons. the lemma is not used otherwise.
  the pattern is re-used several time during proofs, but not this lemma
  in the hope that is_interval starts using large comparisons. *)
Lemma interval_connected_le (I : interval R) (a b c : R) :
  a \in I -> b \in I -> a <= c <= b -> c \in I.
Proof.

Lemma near_0_in_interval (a b : R) :

Proof.

(* This is an example that appears in the following proof.  I think
  there could be a use case for tactic that leads the user to proving
  a conjunction by addressing the second component with the assumption
  that the first one already holds. *)
Fact itv_example (x e  : R):
